This is just the first version tested to ensure the browser (chromium) can work with the metmask plugin.
so running the test is only at the basic level.
I'm continuing to implement the handle for managing multiple tabs to work with Magiclink

How to run?
1. Clone this repo
2. run the file test.js in playround folder
node playground/test.js
